A set of shortcuts to make interaction with Claude web UI more keyboard-oriented.

* Alt+N to start a new thread.
* Alt+D to delete the current thread and start a new one.

To load the extension from sources in Chrome:

* Open chrome://extensions/ and enabled "Developer mode"
* Load the extension via "Load unpacked" button

### Notes

* Would be nice remove the need to manually manage organisation ID.
* Evaluate what's required to make it work in Firefox too.
